# Gwei
A minimal theme based on [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor). It shares roughly the same goals in addition to: 
 - Reducing external CSS, JavaScript and fonts to zero
 - Removing as many CSS hacks as possible and embracing Bruce Lee's philosophy of "Be water, my friend" (inspired by [Chen Hui Jing](https://www.chenhuijing.com)).

 You can see this theme in action on my website, [robin.pm](https://robin.pm).

 The name gwei derives from the Cantonese word, é¬¼ (gwai1), which roughly translates to "ghost".

## Are you using Vapor?

If you're using Vapor on a live site, I'd love if you'd send me a message with the URL. I enjoy seeing the customizations and implmentations taking place all over the world. Regardless, thanks for using Vapor!
